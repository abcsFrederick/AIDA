# Local AIDA data

Images within this directory are by default available to AIDA via a static file server. They will be visible in the AIDA web interface dashboard.

Tile images (.tiff) and those that support IIIF require a separate image server running concurrently. See the [Github documentation](https://github.com/alanaberdeen/AIDA#support-for-tiled-images-international-image-interoperability-framework-iiif) for details.
